Run Make Targets
You can run specific targets by using the make command followed by the target name. For example:

To build all containers: make build
To run a specific service test: make SERVICE_NAME=<service_name> run
To check code quality: make lint
To remove temporary artifacts: make clean
Here are some examples of running Make targets:

# Build all containers
make build

# Run tests for a specific service (e.g., my_service)
make SERVICE_NAME=my_service run

# Check code quality
make lint

# Remove temporary artifacts
make clean
4. Display Available Targets
To display the available targets in the Makefile, you can use the make help target:

make help
This will show a list of all the available targets and their descriptions.

Tips and Variations
You can run multiple targets at once by separating them with spaces: make build lint clean
To see the detailed output of a target (without the @ symbol suppression), you can use the --verbose flag: make --verbose build
If you have multiple Makefiles in your project, you can specify which one to use by providing its path: make -f /path/to/other/makefile build
